## KSINV and UKSINV programs
![Status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=Status&message=Preliminary%20Version&color=orange)

The programs `KSINV` and `UKSINV` solve the inverse Kohn-Sham (KS) problem in the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted cases, respectively.
In the spin-restricted case, the KS inversion determines the KS potential for a given target density.
In the spin-unrestricted case, the KS potentials for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ spin channels are determined for given target electron densities for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons.  
The program is designed to work with densities provided by many-body methods such as Coupled Cluster (CC) or Configuration Interaction (CI). The implementation of KS inversion follows the so-called response function approach proposed in Ref. 1. The actual implementation for closed-shell systems was described and tested in Ref. 2. The extension to open-shell systems was described in Ref. 3.

**NOTE:** We have tutorial which provides practical Hands-on examples about the use of `KSINV` and `UKSINV` programs and post-processing of results of calculations. This tutorial is a good supplement to this documentation. [Link to Tutorial](https://github.com/EgorTrushin/tutorials/blob/main/KS_inversion.ipynb)

**Important:** Read carefully the information below about the selection of basis sets and the `thr_fai_oep` parameter:  
Kohn-Sham inversion calculations requires to specify two basis sets, namely orbital and OEP basis sets. The orbital basis set is the primary basis set for e.g. the representation of orbitals and the calculation of energy contributions. The OEP basis set is the auxiliary basis set for representing e.g. the exchange-correlation potential. 
Gaussian basis set KS inversion methods for a long time suffered from numerical instabilities resulting from problems in balancing the orbital basis sets with the auxiliary basis sets.
Present implementation of KS inversion in Molpro use a preprocessing of the auxiliary basis set that enables such balancing in an automatic fashion for standard Gaussian basis sets.
The preprocessing step removes linear combinations of auxiliary basis functions that couple poorly to products of occupied times unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. It involves the threshold `thr_fai_oep`, which determines how many linear combinations of auxiliary basis functions are removed and varies with respect to the size of the orbital basis set used. This scheme was tested using Dunning correlation consistent basis sets aug-cc-pwCVXZ (X = T, Q, 5) and recommended thresholds are

| Orbital basis set | **thr_fai_oep** |
| :----: | :----: |
| aug-cc-pwCVTZ  |  5e-2   |
| aug-cc-pwCVQZ  | 1.7e-2  |
| aug-cc-pwCV5Z  |  5e-3   |

These thresholds are also expected to work for orbital basis sets without augmentation cc-pwCVXZ (X = T, Q, 5) and without core-polarization functions aug-cc-pVXZ (X = T, Q, 5).
 
As an auxiliary basis set (OEP), the aug-cc-pVXZ/mp2fit (X=T,Q,5) family of basis sets is recommended. In particular, it is recommended to use the aug-cc-pVDZ/mp2fit auxiliary basis sets for atoms up to neon and the aug-cc-pVTZ/mp2fit auxiliary basis sets for heavier atoms.
 
Def2 basis sets of Ahlrichs family of similar quality also might work, but were not tested extensively in practice.

It may be useful to split the reference density and KS inversion calculations into two separate calculations. In this case, the reference density can be saved as:
```
basis={
default,aug-cc-pwCVQZ ! orbital basis
}

symmetry,nosym ! KSINV does not use symmetry

And then the KS inversion can be performed:
```

}

Since KS exchange, correlation and exchange-correlation potentials are important outcomes of KS inversion, we provide an illustration of how to plot these potentials. Let us assume that we have performed calculations for CO with the following options:
```
acfd;ksinv,refden=1325.1,e_ref=-113.285493180105,thr_fai_oep=1.7d-2,\
plot_vx=1,plot_vc=1,plot_vxc=1,plot_vref=1,plot_z=1
```
At the end the files `vref-total-final-z.csv`, `vx-total-final-z.csv`, `vc-total-final-z.csv` and `vxc-total-final-z.csv` are written which contain required data for plotting potentials. 
The exchange-correlation potential consist of a reference exchange potential $v_x^{ref}$ and a remainder $v_{\bar{x}c}$:
$$v_{xc}=v_x^{ref}+v_{\bar{x}c}$$
We also have access to the individual part of the reminder $v_{\bar{x}c}$, namely a reminder of the exchange potential $v_{\bar{x}}$ and the correlation potential $v_c$.
The correlation potential $v_c$ can be plotted as it is. The exchange potential is the sum of the reference exchange potential $v_x^{ref}$ and the corresponding reminder $v_{\bar{x}}$:
$$v_x=v_x^{ref}+v_{\bar{x}}$$


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

vref = pd.read_csv('vref-total-final-z.csv')
vx = pd.read_csv('vx-total-final-z.csv')
vc = pd.read_csv('vc-total-final-z.csv')
vxc = pd.read_csv('vxc-total-final-z.csv')

plt.plot(vx.z, vref.value+vx.value, color='orangered', label='$v_x$')
plt.plot(vc.z, vc.value, color='orange', label='$v_c$')
plt.plot(vxc.z, vref.value+vxc.value, color='dodgerblue', label='$v_{xc}$')

plt.ylabel('Potential (Hartree)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('r (Bohr)', fontsize=16)
plt.ylim(-2, 0.35)
plt.xlim(-5, 5)
plt.legend(frameon=False, fontsize=14)
plt.show()
```

We have tested several post-Hartree-Fock methods for preparing reference densities. Below are examples of how to perform calculations using these methods, which store the density matrix in a record and in a file: 

For FCI in closed-shell case:
```
{FCI;core;dm,1325.1}
{matrop;load,den,den,1325.1;write,den,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

For CCSD:
```
{CCSD;core;dm,1325.1}
{matrop;load,den,den,1325.1;write,den,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

For CCSD(T):
```
{CCSD(T);core;dm,1325.1}
{matrop;load,den,den,1325.1;write,den,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

Then one can read `dm.dat` from disc as `{matrop;read,den,type=density,file=dm.dat;save,den,1325.1}`.

For FCI in open-shell case:
```
{fci;dm,1325.1;core}
{matrop;export,1325.1,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

For RS2:
```
{rs2;dm,1325.1;core}
{matrop;export,1325.1,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

For CISD
```
{ci;save,density=1325.1,spinden;core}
{matrop;export,1325.1,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

For AQCC:
```
{aqcc;save,density=1325.1,spinden;core}
{matrop;export,1325.1,dm.dat,status=rewind,prec=sci}
```

Then one can read `dm.dat` from disc as: `{matrop;import,2140.2,file=dm.dat}`

CCSD and CCSD(T) implementation in Molpro does not allow to store density matrix when applied to open-shell systems. Therefore, we must use CI code in this case, namely FCI, RS2, CISD, and AQCC. RS2 can store only total density, thus it can be used only in the spin-restricted inversion. For RS2, CISD, and AQCC, one can also use multi-reference variants which potentially are more accurate.
